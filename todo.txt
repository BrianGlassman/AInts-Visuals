switch from using combined primitives to a centerline with offset

look into using LINE_LOOP to make a wireframe? The LEGO example used a wireframe, too, but I think a different methodology

use VBOs (ref Ex. 8) for performance improvement

May be better to use a pixel shader?
Marching cubes? Some other isosurface algorithm?

May want to use a DisplayList instead of VBO (so that I can store transformations, not just vertices)
	note: deprecated in OpenGL 3, although it's still available through compatibility

have a player option for switching between back-cull (exterior) and front-cull (interior) for tunnel/chamber walls
