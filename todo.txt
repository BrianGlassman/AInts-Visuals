PROBLEMS:
	processing time is too long, need to either simplify the object or reduce the voxel count


specular lighting doesn't do anything?
	did I set the shininess?

should be a way to move the light and camera around so that it's easier to grade

toBuild movement should change with view direction, probably
	include instructions for moving toBuild in README, once I've figured out what they are




default to not showing the light source trace (red and blue lines) because that might be what's causing the problem

do what prof said: make a wrapper that sets color AND material, and use this everywhere
also make textures brighter


[thanksgiving] buildings and other ants
	idea: somehow invert the Z-buffer or something. Only render parts of the building that would be occluded by chamber walls
	ex 37(maybe? Whatever was shown in class 12/1) deals with the stencil buffer, so may be helpful here
		IMPORTANT NOTE: stencil buffer is complicated, so should rewatch this lecture if I end up using stencil buffer
	could maybe do something involving setting the stencil buffer per-chamber, and clear it at the start of the next chamber
	also might be able to set VALUES in the stencil buffer. So only draw if the Z-buffer value is greater/less than the value stored in the stencil buffer
	could also do some trick using textures? See example whatever-was-second-half-of-12/1

figure out how to do 3d texturing that can handle Z axis lines





should check which menu options don't currently work and implement or remove them
	toggle ambient light
	toggle directed light
	toggle smooth/flat shadows
	...?


make interior eye position stop moving when new structures are added

should add a check "glGetIntegervl(GL_MAX_TEXTURE_UNITS, n)" where n is however many textures I need to use
	there's also a check for max texture size
	basically just look at whatever example he's going through about 50 minutes into class on 12/1



something wrong with Makefile again. Was getting a bad_alloc that got fixed by clean-then-make

At least one of the FIXMEs was because I changed a compile warning. Should address that well ahead of time just in case

for release: remove everything that has a "// NORELEASE" tag
	CANNOT just delete the lines. Sometimes the tag just means a comment that's part of the line




have a player option in exterior view for switching between back-cull (exterior) and front-cull (interior) for tunnel/chamber walls


[stretch0] texture variations
[stretch1] merge adjacent chambers
[stretch2] shadowing
[stretch3] custom shader for cutatways to create a smooth cut
[stretch4] animations to ants/buildings
[stretch5] collision detection for interior view movement


OPTIONAL IMPROVEMENTS
----------------------
do a second noise pass with lower magnitude and smaller cell size to create variation within the walls
	if this is done after the first pass and applies to the post-noise vertices, should still be proof against crossover as long as {S < 0.5 * cellSize}
	
use a different noise scale for chambers so that they can be more varied than tunnels can reasonably handle
	risks crossover, though

May want to use a DisplayList instead of VBO (so that I can store transformations, not just vertices)
	note: deprecated in OpenGL 3, although it's still available through compatibility

use VBOs (ref Ex. 8) for performance improvement

May be better to use a pixel shader?
Marching cubes? Some other isosurface algorithm?

	https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~jrs/meshpapers/Bloomenthal.pdf
	
make orbiting lights based on fixed speed, not display speed
	the Thunderbirds example probably has this capability

would like to have better 3D navigation for interior view, but the vector math gets nasty
	current version has "up" locked to Y axis, so turning is always around that axis instead of relative to view





HOPEFULLY DONE
---------------
I think that the normals are being perturbed correctly, but it's hard to tell for sure. Especially on more complex surfaces.

[SOLUTION] Hopefully this has been fixed by using "float azimuth = 0, elevation = 0" instead of "float azimuth, elevation" but need to keep an eye on it
about 1/3 of the time the light doesn't show up at all. WTF????
	in some scenes it's at the wrong Y value, may or may not be related

[SOLUTION] fixed by implementing a Bezier curve fade, although this is still a good condition to test with						
seed = 1669398889 the side-tunnel just below the Hill gets smushed

[SOLUTION] Might have been fixed by resetting the eyePos to match the CL node in Display? Not sure
resizing the window in Interior view very much does not work

[SOLUTION] mathed it out on a whiteboard (phone photo) and as long as both noise vectors are scaled by S and S < 0.5 points can't ever cross
prevent neighboring vertices from overlapping
	change how much the perturbation applies based on the line length? Probably not. That limits the max displacement
	somehow ensure that all lines are the same length? That way a fixed perturbation value (lineLength * 0.49) will always be ok
		also need to ensure open spaces (ex. between opposite walls) are larger than this value, but that should be fine
	do multiple perturbation passes? Large displacement for broad strokes applies to long edges, then smaller displacements use smaller edges
	bias or constrain the perturbations? ex. each vertical slice of a tunnel can only perturb up or down


DONE
----------------
[initial] predefined layout
[initial] placeholder textures and lighting
[initial] meshes for tunnels and empty chambers, with adjacent structures connecting to each other

[thanksgiving] exterior and interior views, with movement controls
[thanksgiving] random noise perturbations

[final] place new structures and delete existing ones
[final] UI menu to select which structure to place
[final] 3D grid visualization and ghost of to-be-placed
	note: didn't do 3D grid visualizing because it isn't really needed with the WASD control scheme
