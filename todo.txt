look into using LINE_LOOP to make a wireframe? The LEGO example used a wireframe, too, but I think a different methodology

add "return to default" functions for lighting, materials, textures, colors, etc.

use VBOs (ref Ex. 8) for performance improvement

make orbiting lights based on fixed speed, not display speed

May be better to use a pixel shader?
Marching cubes? Some other isosurface algorithm?

May want to use a DisplayList instead of VBO (so that I can store transformations, not just vertices)
	note: deprecated in OpenGL 3, although it's still available through compatibility

have a player option in exterior view for switching between back-cull (exterior) and front-cull (interior) for tunnel/chamber walls
