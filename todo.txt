toggle for texture usage

specular lighting doesn't do anything?
	did I set the shininess?

should be a way to move the light and camera around so that it's easier to grade

toBuild movement should change with view direction, probably
	include instructions for moving toBuild in README, once I've figured out what they are

hotkeys to show off functionality
	PROMINENTLY documented in README

FPS tanks in full screen, especially when inside the Mine
	implies the problem is with per-pixel calculations (shader) not caused by array-ification

build on Windows box

	
option to increase the light levels

Build menu shouldn't be accessible in Interior View

[RELEASE] Get rid of Debug menu option for Release

[RELEASE] clean out old and unused code / files
	main.cpp for menus, noise

README documentation of overall code structure?

go through Key and Special functions, make sure all the keys are documented in README

include time spent in README

check for anything substantially uncommented and comment it

[RELEASE] default to not showing the light source trace (red and blue lines) because that might be what's causing the problem

replace tabs with spaces



should check which menu options don't currently work and implement or remove them
	toggle ambient light
	toggle directed light
	toggle smooth/flat shadows
	...?


for release: remove everything that has a "// NORELEASE" tag
	CANNOT just delete the lines. Sometimes the tag just means a comment that's part of the line

README update


have "Toggle wireframe" show a wireframe with polygon offset even when filled geometry is active
add "Toggle filled"


Go to OH Thursday to make sure it runs on his machine?


SHOULD DO, BUT PROBABLY WON'T
------------------------------

{
	make interior eye position stop moving when new structures are added
	Errors out if you delete the Structure that eyePoint is inside of
} can solve both these by having it set CL idx to be whichever one is closest to where it used to be on building create/Destroy

[thanksgiving] buildings: farm

[thanksgiving] ants

[thanksgiving] cutaway view
	idea: somehow invert the Z-buffer or something. Only render parts of the building that would be occluded by chamber walls
	ex 37(maybe? Whatever was shown in class 12/1) deals with the stencil buffer, so may be helpful here
		IMPORTANT NOTE: stencil buffer is complicated, so should rewatch this lecture if I end up using stencil buffer
	could maybe do something involving setting the stencil buffer per-chamber, and clear it at the start of the next chamber
	also might be able to set VALUES in the stencil buffer. So only draw if the Z-buffer value is greater/less than the value stored in the stencil buffer
	could also do some trick using textures? See example whatever-was-second-half-of-12/1

[thanksgiving] [optional] have a player option in exterior view for switching between back-cull (exterior) and front-cull (interior) for tunnel/chamber walls

should add a check "glGetIntegervl(GL_MAX_TEXTURE_UNITS, n)" where n is however many textures I need to use
	there's also a check for max texture size
	basically just look at whatever example he's going through about 50 minutes into class on 12/1


OPTIONAL IMPROVEMENTS
----------------------
do a second noise pass with lower magnitude and smaller cell size to create variation within the walls
	if this is done after the first pass and applies to the post-noise vertices, should still be proof against crossover as long as {S < 0.5 * cellSize}
	
use a different noise scale for chambers so that they can be more varied than tunnels can reasonably handle
	risks crossover, though

May want to use a DisplayList instead of VBO (so that I can store transformations, not just vertices)
	note: deprecated in OpenGL 3, although it's still available through compatibility

use VBOs (ref Ex. 8) for performance improvement

May be better to use a pixel shader?
Marching cubes? Some other isosurface algorithm?
	https://www3.cs.stonybrook.edu/~qin/courses/visualization/visualization-surface-rendering-with-polygons.pdf
	https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~jrs/meshpapers/Bloomenthal.pdf
	
make orbiting lights based on fixed speed, not display speed
	the Thunderbirds example probably has this capability

would like to have better 3D navigation for interior view, but the vector math gets nasty
	current version has "up" locked to Y axis, so turning is always around that axis instead of relative to view

could maybe remove the sides of caps, but would have to have a way to make sure they aren't visible from inside

[stretch0] texture variations
[stretch1] merge adjacent chambers
[stretch2] shadowing
[stretch3] custom shader for cutatways to create a smooth cut
[stretch4] animations to ants/buildings
[stretch5] collision detection for interior view movement




HOPEFULLY DONE
---------------
[STATUS] stashed and labelled the changeset, but it hasn't happened since
something wrong with Makefile again. Was getting a bad_alloc that got fixed by clean-then-make

I think that the normals are being perturbed correctly, but it's hard to tell for sure. Especially on more complex surfaces.

[SOLUTION] Hopefully this has been fixed by using "float azimuth = 0, elevation = 0" instead of "float azimuth, elevation" but need to keep an eye on it
about 1/3 of the time the light doesn't show up at all. WTF????
	in some scenes it's at the wrong Y value, may or may not be related

[SOLUTION] fixed by implementing a Bezier curve fade, although this is still a good condition to test with						
seed = 1669398889 the side-tunnel just below the Hill gets smushed

[SOLUTION] Might have been fixed by resetting the eyePos to match the CL node in Display? Not sure
resizing the window in Interior view very much does not work

[SOLUTION] mathed it out on a whiteboard (phone photo) and as long as both noise vectors are scaled by S and S < 0.5 points can't ever cross
prevent neighboring vertices from overlapping
	change how much the perturbation applies based on the line length? Probably not. That limits the max displacement
	somehow ensure that all lines are the same length? That way a fixed perturbation value (lineLength * 0.49) will always be ok
		also need to ensure open spaces (ex. between opposite walls) are larger than this value, but that should be fine
	do multiple perturbation passes? Large displacement for broad strokes applies to long edges, then smaller displacements use smaller edges
	bias or constrain the perturbations? ex. each vertical slice of a tunnel can only perturb up or down


DONE
----------------
[initial] predefined layout
[initial] placeholder textures and lighting
[initial] meshes for tunnels and empty chambers, with adjacent structures connecting to each other

[thanksgiving] exterior and interior views, with movement controls
[thanksgiving] random noise perturbations

[final] place new structures and delete existing ones
[final] UI menu to select which structure to place
[final] 3D grid visualization and ghost of to-be-placed
	note: didn't do 3D grid visualizing because it isn't really needed with the WASD control scheme
