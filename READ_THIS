Treat like a conference:
	tell em what you're going to talk about
	tell em the thing
	tell em what you just said

use slides, but don't read the slides as the presentation
slides are entirely optional

for me, probably use slides for the visuals and then talk off the cuff

main thing is make sure audience can follow
(i.e. provide any foundational knowledge needed)


Pick one of three topics:
	cover material not covered in class
	talk about Gotchas
		the problem I saw
		how I figured out what was wrong
		how I fixed it
		(basically walk through the troubleshoot process)
	talk about something totally different
		Example he gave was talking about animation:
			how it's done
			why it's hard
			how I did it

So I should be totally good to do "how noise works and why it's hard"

Can present to parentals as practice? Or Hanna

Email slides to prof BEFORE class on Thursday
	he will have the program (already built)
	best to use PDF of slides to make sure formatting is good

What to turn in:
	review Expectations doc
	README!!!!!
		"I'm looking for a reason to give you an A"
		highlight all the things I did, give ammo to give me an A
		give buttons as shortcuts to particular views
			(ideally number keys so he can go left to right through all)

Can go to office hours Thursday to try to run my program on his machine
